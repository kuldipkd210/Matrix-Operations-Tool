# Matrix-Operations-Tool
A Python-based GUI application built using Tkinter and NumPy that enables users to perform core matrix operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, and determinant calculation. It accepts text-based matrix input, validates dimensions, handles errors gracefully, and displays accurate results instantly.



How It Works

Enter Matrix A in the first text box.

Enter Matrix B in the second text box (required for add, subtract, multiply).

Use buttons to perform operations.

Results are displayed in the “Result” section.

Matrix Input Example:

1 2 3
4 5 6


Rows separated by new lines

Elements separated by spaces
